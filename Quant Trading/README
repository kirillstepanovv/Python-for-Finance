Simple Linear Model for full out of sample prediction 
Based on Macro data from FRED and Option Derived Signals from papers published by Grigory Vilkov 
Two step FamaMacbeth process was used to estimate the factor betas, where necessary 
The algorithm improves the Sharpe Ratio by 1.1% over the benchmark - the value weighted portfolio 
Maximum Sharpe Ratio was used for portfolio optimisation 
The outperformance is attributed to lower average and maximum drawdowns
